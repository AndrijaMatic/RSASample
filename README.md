# RSASample

This repository contains a small C# project that demonstrates how the RSA algorithm can be implemented and used. The project is intended for learning and educational purposes only.

## Purpose

- Learn how RSA works and how to implement it in C#.
- Provide a simple, readable example to experiment with key generation, encryption and decryption.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided purely for education. It is not production-ready and must not be used to protect real data or in any security-critical scenario.

## Requirements

- .NET 8 SDK
- A code editor such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or Rider

## Building and running

From the repository root:

```bash
cd RSASample
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Or run the project directly with the full project path:

```bash
dotnet run --project RSASample/RSASample.csproj
```

## What to explore

- Read the implementation to understand the math behind key generation, encryption and decryption.
- Try different key sizes and see how they affect performance and output.
- Add tests and logging to verify behavior and improve learning.

## Contributing

This is a small educational project. Contributions that improve clarity, documentation or educational value are welcome.

## License

No license is specified. Use the code for learning only and do not rely on it for production security.
